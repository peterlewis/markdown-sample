# Getting Started

Welcome to the getting started section! This guide will help you understand the documentation structure.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A markdown editor
- Basic understanding of markdown syntax
- Familiarity with YAML frontmatter

You can use any text editor, but we recommend VS Code with the Markdown All in One extension.

## What is Frontmatter?

Frontmatter is metadata placed at the top of markdown files, enclosed in `---` delimiters:

```yaml
---
title: "Page Title"
description: "Page description"

```

{{< note type="warning" >}}
Frontmatter must be at the very beginning of the file, before any content.
{{< /note >}}
